## Sprint-1 Overview
You have been approached by an entrepreneur to build out a prototype for a new video streaming platform called BrainFlix. The entrepreneur has meetings lined up for funding with several VCs and needs the prototype built within the next three weeks. BrainFlixâ€™s Creative Director has provided you with a package and mockup of how they envision the final product. There is also a separate team that is currently working on a backend API needed to integrate with the front-end, but for the time being the static function components need to be put together.

- Create a functioning and responsive app prototype from the project designs provided.

## Sprint-2 Overview
For this next sprint, they have provided a mock API that will provide some hard-coded movie data that you can use to start building out the functionality of your front-end application. You will also be required to add a second page to the site that will be used for adding new video content to the site.

- Leverage your HTML, CSS, and React skills to enhance what you built-in Sprint 1.
- Use provided mock API to add functionality 

## Sprint-3 Overview
A decision has been made to build out an actual API for the prototype and move away from using the mock API. The team at BrainFlix is confident in your ability to build out this new API, and have tasked you to develop it for this final sprint.

- Using the mock API as your guide, build out your own API service that will manage the video data, and update the client application to use your API service. 
- Create a new repository for your server-side code.
